# Data Analysis and Visualizations Project

## Introduction

This is my **Data Analysis and Visualizations Project**.

### Why Python?

As you may know, **Python is undoubtedly the best programming language for data analysis and visualizations**. Python has surpassed other languages like R in this area. The secret lies in Python's **vast variety of libraries**, which I combined to:

- Enhance data analysis reports and visualizations
- Integrate with other Python libraries to build complete applications, such as web or desktop apps
- Automate processes and tasks

## What I Learned

**I learned the logic behind data analysis—what one should do when he/she faces a real data analysis project.** I also got to understand the field of geospatial data analysis by doing this project.

### Real Data, Real Insights

I used a dataset of around **45,000 records**, and turned this raw data into meaningful information. So, I learned what data analysis and visualization is all about: **transforming data into information**.

For example,  answered questions such as:  
> *What is the day of the week when people are the happiest?*

The raw data is just numbers and text. Knowing which day of the week people are happiest—that’s actionable information.

## Data Visualization

A major part of this section is **data visualization**. I learned how to make some interactive plots such as:

- **Line plots** (e.g., showing the average rating for each day, with date on the X axis and average rating on the Y axis)
- **Pie charts** (to visualize category proportions)
- **Other interactive charts** tailored to your data

Not only did I learned how to create these charts, but I also discovered how to make **any type of chart to suit my dataset** and my storytelling needs.
